# Backend Microservice Notification service (Learning)

The purpose of this application is to learn how to use nest.js and some other backend technoligies.
I will be using node.js, nest.js, prisma, typescript, redis, jest, and SOLID principles to build
the notification service. It will be useful to learn concepts like inmemory database,
repositories, and DDD.

A kafka cluster was created with upstash to make this app a consumer.

This app is part of the quick course from rocketseat ignite lab.
