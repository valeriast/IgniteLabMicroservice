# Backend Microservice Notification service (Learning)

The purpose of this application is to learn how to use nest.js and some other backend technoligies.
I will be using node.js, nest.js, prisma, typescript, redis, jest, and SOLID principles to build
the notification service. It will be useful to learn concepts like inmemory database,
repositories, and DDD.

This app is part of the quick course from rocketseat ignite lab.
